This is a toy-project the sole goal of each was for me to
learn to use Jetpack Compose for Android application as per
my university assignment.The code base violates the basic
OOP principles, there also are some general architecture
problems. The assignment has had strict and unreasonable
requirements to use outdated technologies in ways that were
not anyhow optimal or according to general consensus. I do
plan to fix the application by replacing TCP sockets with
HTTP protocol and fix the current multithreading model to
usage of coroutines.
